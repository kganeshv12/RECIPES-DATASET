      ""The first step will be cutting up your chicken thighs in chunks of your preference. I personally like to make the cubes approximately 1cm x 1cm, because I don't like to grill the satay for too long. Most important is that you are consistent in the cutting size, so that your satay will cook evenly. Then put all the other satay ingredients in a bowl and give a whisk, add your chicken and put in the fridge for at least one hour but ideally overnight. If you are using wooden skewers, make sure you soak them in water to prevent burning on the BBQ."",

Then add all the other sauce ingredients and make sure you put it on your smallest burner on a real low heat. Slowly simmer the sauce for about 5 minutes and your satay sauce will be finished. If you cook your satay sauce too long or on a high heat you will see that all the oil from the peanuts and the coconut milk separate and start floating on top, that is not what we are aiming for!"",
      ""Skew your chicken satay on the soaked skewers and now it's time to grill the satay. Ideally we do this on a BBQ but sometimes you want to make this dish in winter or you don't want to start a fire. In this case, you can also use a griddle pan. Grill your satays on a medium-high heat and make sure you keep turning them often. After about 5 minutes of grilling (depending on your chunk size) your chicken satay will be ready to eat. Serve with the peanut sauce. Enjoy!""

Continue cooking uncovered for about 50 minutes or until it thickens and most of the water evaporates. Add peas in the last 10 minutes of cooking. Taste and adjust seasonings accordingly. Once done, transfer to a large plate, spreading it out to expedite cooling and ease handling."",

Note: If you are using milk instead of buttermilk, leave out the baking soda. Baking soda reacts with the acid in the buttermilk to help with leavening, if milk is used then it is not needed."",

If you do not have a pastry blender you can either use two knives and slash them against each other, use your hands to squish the butter or if you have a food processor you can pulse it a few times."",
    ""Gradually add 1 cup Buttermilk (or milk) to the dry ingredients, if using milk you will need less of it since it isn't as thick.

    ""Once they are all cut, remove the cast iron skillet from the oven and carefully place each biscuit into the hot oil (if using). Carefully flip over each biscuit so both sides are coated in oil, this will ensure both sides get browned. You want to place them closer together but not touching. As they start to expand, they will be forced to expand upwards instead of outwards."",

    ""note"": ""Best Potatoes for Latkes: Starchy potatoes, like Russet or Yukon Gold, are ideal for this recipe as they yield a crispier pancake.\n\nBatter Consistency: Ensure the consistency of the batter is thick enough to hold together. If it seems too wet, you can add a bit more flour. Conversely, if it feels too dry, consider adding another egg.\n\nPotato Starch: After squeezing the water from the grated potatoes, don’t discard the liquid immediately. Let it settle for a moment. At the bottom of the bowl, you’ll notice some potato starch sediment. This is pure potato starch, and you can carefully pour off the water and then add this starch back into your potato mixture. It can enhance the texture of the pancakes and make them more cohesive.\n\nPancake Size: The size of your potato pancakes can vary based on how you intend to serve them. You can opt for smaller or larger sizes. My grandfather, for instance, used to make them as large as the entire pan! 🙂""
